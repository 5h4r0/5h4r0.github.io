OpenNMT is used as provided in <a href="http://demo-pnmt.systran.net/">production</a> by major translation providers.
The system is designed to be simple to use and easy to extend, while
maintaining efficiency and state-of-the-art translation accuracy.

Features include:

* Simple general-purpose interface, only requires and source/target data files.
* Speed and memory optimizations for high-performance GPU training.
* Extensions to allow other sequence generation tasks such as summarization and image captioning.
