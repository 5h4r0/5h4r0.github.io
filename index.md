The system is designed to be simple to use and easy to extend , while
maintaining efficiency and state-of-the-art translation
accuracy. Features include:

* Speed and memory optimizations for high-performance GPU training.
* Simple general-purpose interface, only requires and source/target data files.
* C-only decoder implementation for easy deployment.
* Extensions to allow other sequence generation tasks such as summarization and image captioning.
